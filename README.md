Hello World API DevOps Project

This is my simple end to end devops workflow. I created a very simple python API using the Flask library and deployed it to Azure using Docker, Github Actions, and Terraform.I created a CI/CD pipeline to build Docker image and pushes to docker Hub on push to main. Also I used my Linux vm to work on this to futher improve with Linux.
